//! Agents Lithe can install and launch, and how each receives its settings.
//!
//! API keys travel over ACP stdio. Codex uses `gateway` authentication; Claude
//! uses its public session options to avoid gateway placeholder credentials.
//!
//! Entries mirror the official ACP registry
//! (`cdn.agentclientprotocol.com/registry/v1/latest/registry.json`): the same
//! agent ids, npm packages, and pinned versions. A version is raised only after
//! the adapter is re-verified, because each adapter speaks its own dialect of
//! authentication and cancellation.
